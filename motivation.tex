In this series of articles I want to explain how interaction graph models
and sign consistency methods are used to model the behavior of dynamical systems.
The focus lies on modeling the behavior of biological systems, although the application to artifical systems is possible.
In particular, I want to show how certain sign consistency methods work, 
 under which assumption they operate,
 which biological questions they allow us to answer,
 and what problems exist. 
My aim is to be very beginner friendly with lots of examples. 
OK, let's dive into it!
Here is a table of content that list the covered topics from which you can cherry pick.
